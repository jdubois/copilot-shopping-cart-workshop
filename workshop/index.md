## The scenario

> **“I added the notebook twice. Why is there still only one in my cart?”**

In this **hands-on workshop**, use **GitHub Copilot App** to take a small Java
shop from a reproducible bug to a reviewed result. Fix cart quantities,
generate item removal, then use a shared **Browser canvas**, **Pick & polish**
and **impeccable** to improve an observed UI issue.

Investigate an N+1 query using **MCP** evidence. Build independent improvements
in two worktree sessions, then integrate their PRs with **Agent Merge**.
Get a second opinion from **rubber duck** and coordinate **five specialist
agents in child App sessions** to implement mock checkout with an order receipt
and safe cart clearing.
Reuse **Agent Merge** to deliver its reviewed PR into your own **`main`**,
then verify the merged application in the orchestrator's session.
Finish with **Chronicle** and a clear handoff.

The shop is intentionally small: Spring Boot, H2 and plain JavaScript.
You do not need Docker, a payment provider, a frontend build or advanced
Hibernate knowledge. BootUI supplies runtime data **through MCP** for the
performance exercise.

## One shop, four tickets

Here, **tickets** are exercise briefs, not GitHub issues.
You do not need to create issues in your repository.

| Ticket | Customer outcome | App practice |
|---|---|---|
| Fix adding the same product twice | Quantity and total accumulate correctly | Plan, use a Java skill, reproduce a failing test and guide the fix |
| Generate item removal | Remove one product without losing the others | Define expected behavior, generate backend and UI code, then preview and polish in a Canvas |
| Fix repeated product queries | The cart keeps its contents with fewer SELECTs | Use MCP evidence, diagnose with a skill, verify the query budget |
| Build and deliver mock checkout | Place a local order, see a receipt and start shopping again from the app on `main` | Agree on contracts, coordinate five subagents, verify failures/retries and deliver a reviewed PR with Agent Merge |

Start with **Fusion Standard**, or a strong coding model if Fusion is unavailable.
Use higher effort when a problem calls for it, not by default.
Review permissions, tests and changed files at every stage.
Each of the first three tickets has a named session and one reviewed PR,
merged before the next task. Removal and Canvas polish share a PR.
After both parallel PRs merge, keep **Cart: boundary tests** for the critique.
Then start a fresh **Cart: mock checkout** session from verified `main`.
Five child sessions build the fourth ticket in **five separate worktrees**;
the checkout session integrates their reviewed commits into **one feature branch**.
**Mock means no real payments**:
the order, receipt and cart clearing must actually work.
The feature branch is a staging point, not the finish line: after your scoped
approval, Agent Merge merges the checkout PR; the orchestrator then verifies actual `main`.

## Workshop flow
{: #workshop-flow}

Start with [setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/setup/), then follow the chapters in
order. There are no chapter deadlines. Take a break before the parallel work
and ask for help whenever you need it.

  <figcaption>From a reproducible cart bug to a verified checkout: the workshop journey, illustrated.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. [Investigate with Copilot]({{ site.baseurl }}/ticket/), using a reproducible cart bug.
2. [Choose modes and effort]({{ site.baseurl }}/modes/), then [use a skill to fix the bug]({{ site.baseurl }}/skills/): generate tests, fix, review and merge the quantity-fix PR.
3. [Generate and iterate]({{ site.baseurl }}/generate/) in a new **Cart: item removal** session from updated `main`.
4. [Use Canvas and Pick & polish]({{ site.baseurl }}/canvas/) in that removal session, then merge the feature and accepted polish in one PR.
5. [Investigate runtime with MCP]({{ site.baseurl }}/tools/) in a new **Cart: query optimization** session, then merge its N+1 fix PR into `main`.
6. [Start two isolated sessions from the reviewed main]({{ site.baseurl }}/parallel/) to improve the empty-cart experience and add boundary tests.
7. [Merge PRs with Agent Merge]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrate/): UI first, then boundary tests, reviewing repairs and authorizing each merge separately.
8. [Review with rubber duck]({{ site.baseurl }}/rubber-duck/) in the existing **Cart: boundary tests** session.
9. [Coordinate five subagents]({{ site.baseurl }}/subagents/) from **Cart: mock checkout**: create five child sessions and worktrees, integrate their handoffs, deliver one reviewed PR with Agent Merge and verify the merged app.
10. [Improve token usage with Chronicle]({{ site.baseurl }}/tokens/) using the workshop sessions.
11. [Review the full change and hand off]({{ site.baseurl }}/finish/#final-review).

## What you will leave with

- A reviewed shop on your own `main` with four tickets, usable UI improvements, a working mock checkout and regression coverage.
- Evidence from previews, tests, MCP, PRs and the independent critique, with unavailable or unfinished work recorded.
- A merged checkout PR showing how five specialists coordinated code and shared decisions, plus a workflow improvement from Chronicle.

## Before you begin

You need JDK 21+, Git and a supported Copilot App account. Create your own
repository from the template; the three Java skills are already included.
Delivery starts with the quantity-fix PR, so you need GitHub Actions and
permission to push branches and merge PRs throughout the workshop.
Local recovery is documented for blocked participants.
The skills chapter also explains how to install them in another project.
The App's Browser canvas, Pick & polish, bundled **impeccable**, rubber duck
and child-session orchestration are used in later exercises; availability
depends on your build and policies. `/fleet` is explained as an alternative.
Each chapter explains how to record a blocked step or demonstration.
Keep the [prompt cards]({{ site.baseurl }}/prompts/) and
[worksheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/worksheet/) nearby.
